/**
 * Bridge to the app's native library for background silent-push handling.
 *
 * The `init` block loads `notifications_demo_lib` — the same `.so` the Tauri
 * runtime uses — but loading it does NOT start Tauri (only `Rust.create()` /
 * `start()` do). That lets the FCM service call [nativeProcessSilentPush] after
 * a cold start, with no Activity/WebView, to "fetch" notification content in
 * Rust (where matrix-rust-sdk would run).
 *
 * Input: the app data directory path, and the FCM data payload as a JSON object
 * string.
 * Output: JSON `{ id, title, body, channelId }`, or `null` on failure.
